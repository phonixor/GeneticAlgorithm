this is a model file, used by the model class.

This file is best viewed with tab=12 (or more)blanks.
any sentence starting with "#" will be seen as the starting block of something it should parse.
parsing is stopped when it reaches an #END block, so do not put anything in between! 
any other lines will be completly ignored so feel free to comment and whine as much as you like
do note however, that all those lovely comments will be gone in any models generated
if you want to have some notes that should be preserved, there is a special section for that below
these instructions will always be printed.

#CONSERVED_NOTES
basic stuff!
#END

next you can set the options per gene:
minprod - the default production without regulation, this is independent of any concentrations
name    - the name used to generate all other names in this file, and the name used in graphs and stuff
decay   - per time unit concentration*decay
#PER_GENE_OPTIONS
prodRate	minprod	decay	name
1	-10	0	gene1
1	0	0	gene2
1	0	0.1	gene3
#END

some gene constructs cannot be measured indivually and are measured in one data set or not at all...
the row positions should be similar to the intial values and data values...
#GENE_V_DATA_RELATIONS
gene1
gene2
gene3
#END

simple reactions are reactions that only have 2 genes involved
they are recognizable by simple arrows in the model: A<->B
or by its differential equation dA/dt = k2*B (-k1*A)
the later however can also be a part of a more complex reaction... in that case it should not be in this matrix...
in doubt always use complex reactions

the position determines which influences which
 XX  AB
Y02 A02
Y00 B00
should be seen as y=2x ~ dy/dt=2[X] ~ dA/dt = k2*B

the values are the rate constants, that can be negative (= represion).
a matrix like this is also called a Wagner's gene network model 
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner
#SIMPLE_REACTIONS
gene1	gene2	gene3	
0	0	0	gene1
-8	1	0	gene2
-2	-1	1	gene3
#END

some more complex reactions look like:
A+B=AB
A+B=C
A+B=A+C
A=A+B
though there are many other possiblities... these are discribed in the matrix bellow
variables that are not in this reaction get the value 0
variables on the left side of the equation get a 1
variables on the right side of the equation get a 2
variables on both sides of the equation get a 3
the corresponding rate constants are in the matrix after that...
#COMPLEX_REACTIONS
Nr	gene1	gene2	gene3	gene4	gene5	
#END

the next matrix contains the values and constraints for the reactions descriped above...
F* = forward reaction (from right to left)
B* = backward reaction (from left to right)
#COMPLEX_REACTIONS_VALUES
Nr	Fval	Fmin	Fmax	Bval	Bmin	Bmax
#END

Last is the initial data, the amount of colums should be the same as in the data

additional settings:
sigma - is a function that will be cast over the regulatory part of the dt's, so not the decay
#SETTINGS
sigma=@(x)(0.5*((x./sqrt((x.^2)+1))+1));
%matlab code here....
this.minDecayParameterRange=0;
this.maxDecayParameterRange=1;
this.minProdParameterRange=-10;
this.maxProdParameterRange=10;
this.freeSimpleReactions=1; %maybe this should be in the settings, and not in the actual model...
